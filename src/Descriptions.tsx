const Descriptions = {
    shader1: 'Shader 1 is based on a shape morphing strategy, first starting with the SDF of a square, then deforming into a circle, and reforming into a sqaure again.  It is rendered through a 2D raytracing process which can make it somewhat computationally expensive, but allows for a bloom-like lighting effect that follows the contours of the shape.  No textures are used, and all coloration is generated procedurally.'
